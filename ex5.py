# Q1
"""
Depth-first search is used to implement topological sorting. 
Topological sort is a linear ordering of the vertices in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) such that for every directed edge u â†’ v, 
vertex u comes before v in the ordering. It helps achieve this because it explores a node's entire path (depth) before backtracking. 
Then, once all descendants of a node are processed, we can safely record that node. Also by pushing nodes to a stack after visiting 
all their neighbors, we ensure that each node is placed after all nodes it depends on.
